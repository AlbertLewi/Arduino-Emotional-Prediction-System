# Arduino-Emotional-Prediction-System
Arduino-based system coded in Java. 
Developed a program that predicts a user’s emotional state using combined light and sound sensor data. The system collects data for 10 seconds, computes statistical averages, and produces a prediction that accounts for user-specific sensitivity profiles and uncertainty weighting.

Integrated an OLED display to provide real-time feedback on system decisions and used JavaFX to visualize sensor trends through dynamic line graphs. Implemented JUnit tests to validate prediction logic, data handling, and edge cases.
