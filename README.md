# Arduino-Emotional-Prediction-System
Arduino-based system coded in Java. 
This program is designed to predict a user's emotion based on combinations of light and sound sensor data. Furthermore, user sensitivity and uncertainty are implemented into the final result/prediction. This program collects light and sensor data for 10 seconds and takes the average, then outputs a prediction based on various factors. An OLED display is also implemented to dynamically display program decisions. JavaFX is used to show relevant data in a line graph.
